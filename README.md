# ER-BA-Network

Our project aims to create a more realistic network model by combining the Barabasi-Albert and Erdosâ€™ Random networks. The former can account for various natural networks, but it does not allow existing nodes to interact. The latter is based on a fixed probability distribution and does not change over time. It only depends on the interactions among existing nodes. We used Python to simulate this hybrid network and analyze its degree distributions and gap formations. We also added the feature of creating random connections within the network. Our next goal is to derive a mathematical formula for the degree distribution of this network.
